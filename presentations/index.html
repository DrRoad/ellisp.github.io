	<h2>Warning / disclaimer!</h2>
   <p>This page contains links to the visual props for presentations I've given as an individual rather than as an official.  Sometimes the boundary gets a little grey; in case of troublesome ambiguity, please draw it to my attention and assume I'm speaking on my own behalf rather than my employer.</p>
   
   <p>They will be in a variety of formats - HTML/JavaScript, PowerPoint and PDF.</p>
   
   <p>I try to build my "slides" for presentations as a starter for my talk, rather than as stand-alone documents.  Consequently, they really are props rather than the entire content; it's not unusual for me to put up a surprising slide specifically to say why it's misleading, for example.  Most of these quite deliberately *should not* make sense if you "weren't there".  Nevertheless, they may be of some interest.
