Source code and text for Peter Ellis' blog 'Stats in the wild'.

The source code is hidden in the <source> branch.  The <master> branch shows files built by Jekyll.  On a development machine, the folders created in the <master> branch should be in a folder called _site, a subfolder of the directory with the <source> branch files.
