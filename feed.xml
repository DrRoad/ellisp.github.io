		<title>Peter&#39;s stats stuff</title>
		<description>I write about applications of data and analytical techniques like statistical modelling and simulation to real-world situations. I show how to access and use data, and provide examples of analytical products and the code that produced them.</description>

				<title>Visualising relationships between children&#39;s books</title>
				        
				
					<description>Statistical methods like hierarchical clustering and principal components analysis can help understand and visualise literary concepts but don&#39;t replace reading the books and engaging with them in traditional critical ways!</description>

				<title>Success rates of appeals to the Supreme Court by Circuit</title>
				        
				
					<description>It&#39;s important to use the correct denominator when considering performance.  While a high percentage (more than 50%) of decisions from the US appeal circuit courts that get all the way to the Supreme Court are overturned, this is only a tiny proportion of total appeals decided by the lower courts.</description>

				<title>Moving largish data from R to H2O - spam detection with Enron emails</title>
				        
				
					<description>I finally solve my problem of writing large sparse matrices from R into SVMLight format for importing to H2O; and demonstrate application with spam detection trained on the Enron email data comparing a generalized linear model, random forest, gradient boosting machine, and deep neural network.</description>

				<title>Does seasonally adjusting first help forecasting?</title>
				        
				
					<description>I test some forecasting models on nearly 3,000 seasonal timeseries to see if it&#39;s better to seasonally adjust first or to incorporate the seasonality into the model used for forecasting.  Turns out it is marginally better to seasonally adjust beforehand when using an ARIMA model and it doesn&#39;t matter with exponential smoothing state space models.  Automated use of Box-Cox transformations also makes forecasts with these test series slightly worse.  The average effects were very small, and dwarfed by different performance on different domains and frequency of data.</description>

				<title>Sparse matrices, k-means clustering, topic modelling with posts on the 2004 US Presidential election</title>
				        
				
					<description>I explore different sparse matrix formats in R and moving data from R to H2O.  Along the way I use k-means clustering and topic modelling to explore textual data from the Daily Kos blog on the 2004 US Presidential election.</description>

				<title>Extracting data on shadow economy from PDF tables</title>
				        
				
					<description>The shadow economy as a percentage of GDP in wealthier countries is in decline; and had a spike in 2009 with the economic crisis.  More research is needed to adequately understand it.  Along the way I experiment with extracting data frames from PDF tables; and show it&#39;s always worthwhile looking at the same data in different ways, which can be as simple as freeing up the vertical axes of graphics.</description>
