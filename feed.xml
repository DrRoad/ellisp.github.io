		<title>Peter&#39;s stats stuff</title>
		<description>I write about applications of data and analytical techniques like statistical modelling and simulation to real-world situations. I show how to access and use data, and provide examples of analytical products and the code that produced them.</description>

				<title>X13-SEATS-ARIMA as an automated forecasting tool</title>
				        
				
					<description>X13-SEATS-ARIMA does not perform particularly well by itself as an automated forecasting tool on the 3,003 test data series in the M3 forecasting competition.  For 412 series it fails to fit a model without manual intervention.  When it does fit a model, on average they perform slightly worse than auto.arima from Hyndman&#39;s forecast package.  It works well as part of a hybrid approach, however.</description>

				<title>Inequality measures in the World Development Indicators</title>
				        
				
					<description>Introduces a new web-app to help navigate and explore the World Bank&#39;s World Development Indicators; and a one-off comparison of the inequality measures available in that collection (just 5 of the 3,500 series available).</description>

				<title>Deaths from assault over time in 40 relatively rich countries</title>
				        
				
					<description>Simple but effective graphics showing relative country standings with regard to deaths from assault, and trends over time.  Most countries in this group are seeing a decline in deaths from assault, from peaks in the 1970s, &#39;80s or &#39;90s.  Data are downloaded from OECD.Stat via their API and SDMX and this post shows how to do this, and also demos screen scraping with {rvest} - not that it needs any demo-ing, it&#39;s so user-friendly.</description>

					<description>Creating a range of ARIMA models by hand by manipulating white noise, instead of arima.sim(), to make clear exactly how they work, and a animation to see several of them unfold.</description>

				<title>Seasonal adjusment on the fly with X-13ARIMA-SEATS, seasonal and ggplot2</title>
				        
				
					<description>I show how to seasonally adjust published electronic card transactions spend in New Zealand using the US Census Bureau&#39;s excellent X-13ARIMA-SEATS software, the Spanish SEATS algorithm and Christoph Sax&#39;s seasonal R package; and how to build a new &quot;stat&quot; for ggplot2 to make it easy to do seasonal adjustment on the fly for a graphic of a time series split by various grouping dimensions.</description>
