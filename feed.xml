		<title>free range statistics</title>
		<description>I write about applications of data and analytical techniques like statistical modelling and simulation to real-world situations. I show how to access and use data, and provide examples of analytical products and the code that produced them.</description>

				<title>A more systematic look at suppressed data</title>
				        
				
				
					<description>A more systematic comparison of different ways of dealing with cells in a cross tab that have been supressed for confidentiality. For the particular model tested here, the best thing to do is the simple method of replacing all suppressed cells with 5; this works even better than using the original unsuppressed data which is very unstable when many cell counts are near zero.</description>

				<title>Suppressed data (left-censored counts)</title>
				        
				
				
					<description>I experiment with some different ways of handling counts in tables that have been suppressed for confidentiality, and come up in favour of multiple imputation. The mice R package helpfully lets you define your own imputation algorithm.</description>

				<title>Understanding the limitations of group-level inequality data</title>
				        
				
				
					<description>Cross-sectional country-level data will show a relationship between income inequality and life expectancy even if inequality itself has no direct impact on life exectancy; so long as there is changing marginal impact of individual income on individual life space (as of course there is).</description>

				<title>Rents in Melbourne</title>
				        
				
				
					<description>Rents in Melbourne have on average grown fastest in suburbs that were the cheapest in 2000; at least for two and three bedroom flats and for two bedroom houses.  Also, scatterplots are awesome.</description>

				<title>Estimating relative risk in a simulated complex survey</title>
				        
				
				
					<description>Simulating complex survey data in order to fit slightly mis-specified relative risk models, we find that confidence intervals&#39; coverage is pretty much as advertised if we use appropriate methods that adjust for the complex survey data, but under-perform if the data is treated naively as coming from a simple random sample.</description>

				<title>Leading indicators of economic growth</title>
				        
				
				
					<description>A demo of a favourite combination of multiple imputation, bootstrap and elastic net regularization.  I look at what are good leading indicators, with reliable data available, of New Zealand&#39;s economic growth.  The results turn out to be last quarter&#39;s economic growth; food prices; visitor arrivals; car registrations; business confidence; and electronic card transactions.</description>
