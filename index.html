       <p>I write about using real data for real purposes.  I show how to access and use data, and provide examples of semi-finished products and the code that produced them.  'In the wild' is metaphorical - I don't write in particular about natural wilderness (although am happy to if the data comes up), as much as the rugged but human-made world of compromise, pragmatism, and difficult practical choices that is real-world data analysis. Occasionally I give extra explanation of published things I have had input to in my day job, but everything written here is my own opinion and on my own responsibility.</p>
