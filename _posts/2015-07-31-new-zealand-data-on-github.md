## New data listing for New Zealand
Wellington's [PrototypeAlex](https://github.com/PrototypeAlex) has created a new [GitHub repository aiming to list data about New Zealand](https://github.com/PrototypeAlex/new-zealand-data).  My first reaction was "why?"  

After all, we already have [data.govt.nz](http://data.govt.nz) which is meant to be the definitive aggregator of government datasets; we have the [Figure.NZ](http://figure.nz) (recently rebranded from "Wiki New Zealand", as it isn't really a Wiki and has evolved into something else, still very useful, entirely) which aims to be: 

> "the place to play with New Zealand's data".  

And according to [PrototypeAlex on Twitter:](https://twitter.com/PrototypeAlex/status/626689156744265728) 

> "There's a heap of NZ data/api metalists floating around, so I made another one."

I think (and am pretty sure so does PrototypeAlex) that the difference is being on GitHub.  This means that anyone with a GitHub account can fork his repository, make and commit additions or corrections, and submit a pull request to him.  I've already done this twice for a bunch of small things I noticed, and he's pretty prompt at incorporating those changes.  In effect, Alex can start crowd sourcing his list.  Maybe he was inspired by Wiki New Zealand dropping the "Wiki" from their name, because that's what he's doing.  It's simple but effective.

We wish him well.
