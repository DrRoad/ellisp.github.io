## Are they really as bad as all that?
I've been mulling over time series charts with two different y axes, which are widely deprecated in the world of people who see ourselves as professional data workers.  Looking down on dual axis time series charts is on the list of things that mark one as a member of a serious data visualiser - after shaking our heads at pie charts, and cringing in horror at three-dimensional chart junk.  But I've come to the surprising conclusion (surprising for me) that the arguments against them don't stack up - at least not to the stage of justifying a blanket ban.

Before I go further, here's my best example of one of these charts with real data, as a talking point.  The data come from the [Reserve Bank of New Zealand](http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/statistics/key-graphs/key-graph-exchange-rate), and my chart below is essentially a cleaned up version of their's (my steps were "remove distracting shadows; remove borders; make the data stand out more; colour code the axes to match the data series.").

![dual](/img/0051-dualgood.svg)

Stephen Few looks at the issue in [a well reasoned piece](https://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/dual-scaled_axes.pdf) and concludes cautiously that they are never justified.  A [nice piece by Keran Healy](https://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2016/01/16/two-y-axes/) looks at a particular example and concludes that the dual axes encourage sloppy thinking with regard to time series causality.  There are a lot of shorter pieces such as [this one](http://junkcharts.typepad.com/junk_charts/2006/05/the_crossover_l.html) pouring scorn on the technique too.  Hadley Wickham is [famously opposed to dual axes](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/3mp9r7/im_hadley_wickham_chief_scientist_at_rstudio_and/) and has made it difficult to use them in ggplot2 (I have to say, in the case of [this example](https://rpubs.com/kohske/dual_axis_in_ggplot2) I agree with Professor Wickham's comment "MY EYES. MY EYES. OH THE HUMANITY").

Here's my attempt at a paraphrase of the case against dual axis charts:

1. The designer has to make choices about scales and this can have a big impact on the viewer
2. In particular, "cross-over points" where one series cross another are results of the design choices, not intrinsic to the data, and viewers (particularly unsophisticated viewers) will not appreciate this and think there is more significance in cross over than is actually the case
3. They make it easier to lazily associate correlation with causation, not taking into account autocorrelation and other time-series issues
4. Because of the issues above, in malicious hands they make it possible to deliberately mislead
5. They often look cluttered and aesthetically unpleasing

All of these points have some substance, but having carefully thought it through I think that they are not conclusive.  I reached this position not by disagreeing with the statements above, but by observing that the same criticisms can be made of most if not all standard methods of representing the sort of data for which a dual axis time series chart would be considered.

Let's look at the alternatives to dual axes charts in the case of the foreign exchange data plotted earlier.

## Facets can sometimes make comparisons more difficult

The most commonly recommended alternative to dual axes is a free scaled facet plot like this one:

![facets](/img/0051-facets.svg)

This is a good graphic, no doubt about it, and I think will often be my preferred approach to this type of data.  Interestingly, this is still basically a dual axis plot.  We've let the vertical axes take two different scales, but by displacing the two facets from eachother we avoid problems like the false "cross-over" points, and we improve the uncluttered aesthetic appeal.  However, it's worth noting that the choice of scale is still a design choice.  This graphic, drawn with `ggplot2` which has good defaults and does not allow easy configuration of faceted vertical axes, rightly chooses vertical scales to maximise use of the page - but the difficulty in over-riding that is a `ggplot` feature, not a feature of faceted scales in general.

Because the choice of scale is a choice by the designer, objections 1 and 4 (arbitrary differing scales, and vulnerable to malicious misleading) apply to this sort of graphic as much as a dual axis plot.  Consider this alternative version:

![facets-bad](/img/0051-facets-bad.svg)

It's a similar plot; I've just changed the vertical limits of the bottom of the two charts.  I had to exit the facet paradigm of `ggplot2` to do this because it rightly makes it difficult to warp the y axes of individual facets; but with a little effort I managed to make it look to a naive viewer as though the US exchange rate is more volatile than the trade weighted index.  

What the facet version *does* do is make it harder to do micro comparisons.  For example, compared to my original superimposed dual axis plot, it's no longer possible to tell in either of the facet versions the periods when changes to the trade weighted index preceded those to the US exchange rate and vice versa.

Finally, splitting the plot into facets does precisely nothing about avoiding problem #3.  The fact is, confusing correlation with causation is rife, and making the correlation less obvious is not a sustainable solution.

## Indexes don't solve the problem either

Here's a second common way of dealing with this problem - converting both variables to a common index so they can use the same scale.  In fact, I'm the author of the 'stat_index()' function in the [`ggseas` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggseas/index.html) which makes it easy to do this in the `ggplot2` universe, and I'm a fan of this approach in the right circumstance too.  Here's how it looks with this data:

![index](/img/0051-index1.svg)

We've now solved problem #1.  Unlike in the dual axis version or its close cousin the free vertical axis facet plot, there is now a natural vertical scale which we can't change for just one data series at a time.  However, problems 2, 3, 4, 5 are not addressed in any way by this.  Consider how the choice of reference period for the index impacts on the crossover point of the series, as shown in this alternative:

![index360](/img/0051-index360.svg)

This revised plot is still ok, but an unsophisticated viewer might see it as telling a different story from the first in terms of which series "catches up" with the other and when (the cross-over objection again).  By constraining ourselves to an index we leave a few less options for arbitrarily changing scales in misleading ways, but we still to need to make design choices that materially impact on the look of the data.

You might think the answer is "always make the earliest point in the series the reference point of the index", so these plots are always showing growth from the beginning of time, but it doesn't take long to think of times when that's going to be an unhelpful restriction.

In converting to an index we haven't addressed the problem of spurious correlation (of course not - how could a graphic do that anyway, except by failing to show the patterns?).  We have still left the designer in charge of key decision about cross over of the series.  And in the process, we have taken a decisive hit in interpretability.  Many of my stakeholders hate indexes with a passion, because of their abstract nature and the difficulty in explaining how they relate to units they are familiar with.

## Connected scatterplots are cluttered, and too complex for most audiences

For analytical purposes I think a connected scatter plot should be the standard choice for examining two continuous variables change over time.  Here's the continuous scatter plot in action for this particular dataset:

![csp](/img/0051-csp.svg)

The strengths and weakenesses of this are apparent.  It's a good plot for seeing the relationship of the two (although a connected scatter plot of the first differences, or growth rates, is often better) but it's cluttered; the data is drawn over itself as time goes on; and its going to be an unfamiliar visual shock for most non-specialist audiences.  It gets worse with longer time series and with seasonal data.  This is a good plot for the exploratory and analytical phases of data analysis but unlikely to be a final presentation graphic.

## How *not* to use dual axes

Here's some examples of how not to create misleading results.


### Don't muck up one of the scales
![bad1](/img/0051-dualbad1.svg)

![bad2](/img/0051-dualbad2.svg)

Those are both instances of arbitrarily playing with the scales of one of the axes to use less vertical space and hence artificially misleading - it looks like one of the series has less variance than the other.  As I pointed out earlier, this can be done even if you have two separate charts; I would argue that the dual axes in fact is revealed as having power precisely because the misleading effect is so important when done with the data series crossing eachother.  With great data comes great responsibility.  In this case, the responsibility is to use a justifiable, objective-if-possible, algorithm to set the scales of the two vertical axes.

### Don't use two completely conceptually different scales (and in particular, *don't* scrawl growth rates all over the original data)

Here's another case that I think is probably never justified, although it is very commonly used:

![bad3](/img/0051-dualbad3.svg)

I hate this format that overlays growth rates on the original data - I find it a crime against aesthetics to start with, but more importantly I find it very difficult to read and I'm sure that's the case for many viewers.  When the scales are so different I see no justification for overlaying the two data series - use two facets in this case.

## The choice to use them

* As Few suggests, the case to use these charts is strongest when the eye is drawn to the pattern over time of an individual series ie horizontal rather than vertical comparisons.  Vertical comparisons between the two series are misleading and need to be discouraged.

* *Don't* use two axes when the unit of measure is the same (eg pass rates out of 100 in exams in two subjects).  There's just too much scope for confusion.  Use a single axis.
* *Don't* use two axes the scales are fundamentally different (eg temperature, and change in temperature).  Use two charts (or two facets, depending on how you look at it).
* *Do* **consider** their use when the scales are comparable (eg two things in which getting larger on the graphic has a similar interpretation - like the two exchange rate variables in my examples)
* Use dual axes rather than an index when the interpretability cost of converting to a common index is greater than acceptable (sorry, I don't have a guideline for when that would be....)
* Don't use when you really have three data series to show, not just two (this should be obvious, but...)

## Good practice when you do use them

In general, playing around with these has led me to the following conclusions for good dual axes charts:

* Use a **consistent process to choose the limits of the two vertical axes**, an objective, automated algorithm if possible.  Often this will mean use as much of the plotting area as possible for each axis; sometimes there will be good subject matter reasons for forcing both axes to cover the full range of possible values for the series they relate to.  If possible, use the same approach for both scales.  Unless there's good reason not to.
* In particular, **make the scales of the axes conceptually similar**.  Don't show growth on one and original data on the other.  Don't use logarithms on one and natural scale on the other.  And so on.  If meeting this principle is difficult because of the complex concepts, measurement and scales you have, you probably don't want to use dual axes.
* **Colour-code** the axes.  This is the single biggest thing that would make most of the dual-axes graphics I see more readable.  And even if you're using Excel it should still be possible.  I'm surprised it's not standard (and believe me it isn't even common).

## Code

Here's the code in R that downloaded the data and produced all the graphics above.  This includes a new `dualplot()` base graphics function that might be useful if, like me, you are a convert to the cautious and careful use of the occasional dual axis time series chart.
