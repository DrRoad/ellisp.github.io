## A management challenge

Between 2011 and 2017 I selected somewhere between 20 and 30 staff and contractors for New Zealand public sector roles with titles like Analyst, Senior Analyst and Principal Analyst.  Alternative names for these roles could have been (and sometimes where) "researcher", "data analyst", "statistician", "R developer", or "data scientist".  I must have been part of over 50 job interviews for such roles, and read some hundreds of technical exercises and perhaps more than 1,000 job applications.  This when my own position was one with title such as Manager Tourism Research and Evaluation, Manager Sector Trends, and Lead - Evidence and Insights.

There's quite a literature out there on the web about [recruiting data scientists](https://www.google.co.nz/search?q=how+to+recruit+data+scientist&rls=com.microsoft:en-US:{referrer:source?}&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&sourceid=ie7&rlz=1I7MXGB_enNZ512&gfe_rd=cr&dcr=0&ei=eZIsWru-A-Tc8wfi75H4CA), but most of it seems to be based in quite a different world from mine.  I don't have the time or the inclination to do a comprehensive study of all the advice, but it seems to fit into several broad categories:

1  "Technical Data Scientist Interview Questions" such as "explain the use of combinatorics in data science", "what is an eigenvalue and eigenvector", "how do you choose the k in k-means cluster analysis" and "write a function that takes in two sorted lists and outputs a sorted list that is their union" (these are all real questions from a site I won't link to).  I mean, WTF?  Would anyone really want to choose your team based on your ability to answer that sort of question of the top of their head in an interview setting?  
2 A reaction to the above, pages that emphasise "non-technical" qualities like enthusiasm for learning, ability to communicate, team orientation, client orientation etc.  These are generally much more sensible.
3 Pages for employers which are more about how to *attract* data scientists, with ideas ranging from higher salaries to giving them time and opportunities to invent cool stuff
4 Pages that have basically no content other than the vacuous ("recruiters, work closely with hiring managers to build out accurate job descriptions") and seem to exist as clickbait advertising bill boards

One problem as I see it around me is that most of the advice out there does not seem based in the real world, at least not the one that I and my peers live in.  

There are two big challenges in the recruitment problem, of which the "recruiting a data scientist" is only a special case (and actually not that special, I think):

- It's *really hard* to judge, on the basis of [anything really]((https://www.wired.com/2015/04/hire-like-google/), who is going to be effective in a role.  Work sample tests, structured interviews, and tests of general cognitive ability are the best methods, but they are all fraught with challenges.  Rubrics and standardisation are really, *really* important - not just out of fairness to the candidates, but to give you, the recruiting manager, a fighting chance of selecting one of the better candidates.  Methods that feel intuitively right to many people - including to managers who haven't been properly knocked into shape by the HR department - such as informal interviews and reference checks are pretty much useless, at least unless they are a small part of a much broader systematic strategy.
- In recruiting for a technical role, most managers (and even more so, recruitment teams advising them) aren't going to have the current, hands-on skills to judge their team's work.  And if a manager does have those skills on the day they became a manager, the skills will quickly degrade both through lack of practice and through the state-of-the-art moving on (particularly in something as fast-changing as data science).  This is a reality, and not just in data science but in any technical field, from the military to medicine.  It causes problems for writing role descriptions, recruitment, and day to day program and workflow management.  Managing this is the day to day challenge for a manager; don't despair, there are methods for doing it and they emphatically do *not* involve being as technically skilled or knowledgeable as all your staff.  The [Johns Hopkins Executive Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/executive-data-science) on Coursera is one resource that takes this seriously in the data science context (I haven't reviewed it in detail, so this is only a tentative endorsement, but the syllabus looks right).
