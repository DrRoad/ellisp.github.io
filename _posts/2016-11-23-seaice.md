A number of data visualisations like those illustrating [this piece in the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/11/17/the-north-pole-is-an-insane-36-degrees-warmer-than-normal-as-winter-descends/?postshare=4511479671672405&tid=ss_tw&utm_term=.7268a7dc9692) have been circulating showing the disturbing rise in temperature at the North Pole and drop in coverage of Arctic sea ice.  I wanted to familiarise myself with the data to see if the presentations are reasonable and faithful (spoiler - they are).  

## Improving a graphic
Here's my own graph of the data:

The Washington Post original that I've shamelessly copied (and I hope improved from) is reproduced for convenience here:

<img src = "/img/0069-original.png" width = "400">

Some of the improvements I've attempted include:

- include all the data for each year, not just five months
- include more years' data - data go back to 1978 (this may be a non-improvement if there are good reasons for cutting the data short, of course, but I don't know them)
- include each individual year, not just a summary of +/- two standard deviations and 2012 picked out
- colour code years in a sequential fashion, and carefully design the legend to make it easy for the eye to follow the downwards pattern in time (there are some alternatives out there that have difficult to read rainbow colouring with no natural ordering)
- careful use of transparency on all the years other than the latest year, to make it stand out
- a bit more detail on the source of the data
- minimal use of tick marks, axes, etc

Not big things, but it makes a nice graphic and I did get my head around the data.  Code at the bottom of this post should work end to end for downloading the data and reproducing the image.

## Time series analysis

Presented with decades worth of daily data, I couldn't resist pulling out the time series analytical toolkit.  To start with, here's a seasonal decomposition down with the help of Cleveland's `stl` loess-based seasonal decomposition, and my `ggseas` package which integrates it into a `ggplot2` graphic workflow:

The downwards trend in the last few decades is if anything even more prominent in this graphic.

I also did a two year forecast using the seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modelling approach.  I adapt the approach set out by Rob Hyndman in [a post on forecasting daily data](http://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/dailydata/), of using a regular Fourier cycle of artificial variables rather than relying on lagging variables by 365.25 days.  This seems to work ok and gets plausible if dispiriting results:

- a likely record low peak sea ice in March 2017 after the coming cold season
- a non-zero chance that for a brief moment in 2018 there will be zero Arctic sea ice at all.

Ho hum.  Melting sea ice doesn't directly impact on sea level (because the ice is already floating on the water), but is a huge warning sign of serious climate change happening as we speak.  Loss of sea ice reflection of the suns rays is also (I understand - I'm an amateur here) a warming factor itself.  Plus its sad for the Arctic eco-system.

This blog post was only possible because of the amazing [USA National Snow and Ice Data Centre](https://nsidc.org/) with extensive datasets from NASA and others. 

Here's the R code that did all the above:
