description: Creating a range of ARIMA models by hand by manipulating white noise, instead of arima.sim(), to make clear exactly how they work, and a animation to see several of them unfold.

<h2>Simulating ARIMA models</h2>
<p>Generating an arbitrary [Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average) model is easy in R with the [arima.sim()](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/arima.sim.html) function that is part of the built-in {stats} package.  In fact I've done it extensively in this blog for various illustrative purposes.  But one cost of doing this for educational purposes is that the mechanics of generating them are hidden from the user (of course, that's the point!).  As was the case in last week's post, I'm motivated by teaching purposes.  I wanted to show people how an ARIMA model can be created, with high school maths and no special lag notation, from white noise.</p>
