description: I show how to seasonally adjust published electronic card transactions spend in New Zealand using the US Census Bureau's excellent X-13ARIMA-SEATS software, the Spanish SEATS algorithm and Christoph Sax's seasonal R package; and how to build a new "stat" for ggplot2 to make it easy to do seasonal adjustment on the fly for a graphic of a time series split by various grouping dimensions.
