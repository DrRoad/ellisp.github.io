## Silver trade
I've been reading  Ronald Findlay and Kevin H. O'Rourke's 2009 book [*Power and Plenty: Trade, War, and the World Economy in the Second Millennium*](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8493.html) and finding it an overall excellent piece of economic history.  I felt the urge to re-express one of their diagrams.  It's a nice little picture, summarising a fantastic piece of work by Jan de Vries pulling together the best understanding of where silver was traded from and to in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.  Here's my final effort:

![image](/img/0015-silver.gif)

Some points worth noting:

* Substantial amounts of silver remained in Europe.  The trade was not, by a long shot, all about shipping silver [from the Americas to China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_Ming_dynasty) via Europe, although this was clearly a significant feature.
* In the earlier period, there was more silver travelling from the Americas via the Pacific (and Manila) to China and the rest of East Asian than via Europe and the Cape of Good Hope.  By the mid eighteenth century, the Europe/Cape route was far larger.
* Contrary to a claim sometimes made, the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644 can't be blamed on a drop in silver imports, as the [seclusion of Japan from the outside world in 1635](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_shogunate) was compensated for by increases from the Americas.

## The original
I don't have access to Vries' original 2003 article: 

* "Connecting Europe and Asia: a quantitative analysis of the Cape-route trade, 1497– 1795". In *Global Connections and Monetary History, 1470– 1800* (ed. D. O. Flynn, A. Gir ´ ldez, and R. von Glahn). Aldershot: Ashgate., 
   
but it must be an impressive piece of detective work.  [Jan de Vries has a web page at Berkeley.](http://history.berkeley.edu/people/jan-devries).  Here's his flow diagrams as reproduced by Findlay and O'Rourke:

Note that the caption says the flows are in kilogrammes per year, but it's obvious from the text that this is a typo and in fact the measures are in tonnes per year.

## Re-creating it
I wanted to improve this diagram in several ways to give it a more immediate visual impact related to the underlying data:

* use colour rather than shape to indicate which areas were producers and which were consumers
* use width of lines to show volumes so it becomes a [Sankey diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankey_diagram)
* use animation to facilitate direct comparison of the two periods

In combination, this should be more effective than the wireframe original at drawing the viewer's eye to the increase in volume in the Americas - Atlantic - Europe - Cape - Asia triangle, and the reduction to nothing in flows from Japan when the Tokugawa regime shut that country to the world and expelled the Portuguese traders who had been making a nice living carrying between China and Japan.

To do this efficiently for two diagrams with onlyh slight differences, I created a function in R just for the purpose of drawing a Sankey chart for different levels of silver flows.  The two images are created separately as PNG files, and then I use ImageMagick to tie them together into an animated GIF.  To allow the whole thing to be run programmatically from R, I send the command to ImageMagick from R, effectively using R as a shell script for that part of the program.  This means I don't need to leave my R development environment to run iterations of the program (for example, while tweaking exactly where each continent's label is placed on the page).

One trick needed for this, common when you want to set a scale to be the same in multiple plots, was to draw an invisible (ie white) ribbon connecting two invisible nodes at the top of the diagram, reflecting movement of 650 tonnes per year of silver between two imaginary locations.  This value is controlled by the cal_width argument in my silver() function below.  As 650 is larger than any of the actual flows, it forms the calibration value against which all the other ribbon widths are defined.  This means the widths of the ribbons in the two images are comparable and on the same scale.
