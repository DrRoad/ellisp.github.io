        		<h1>About 'Stats in the wild'</h1>
				<p>I'm a professional statistician - or possibly a data scientist - managing an analytics team in a New Zealand government Ministry.  Most of my career has been in management and evaluation of overseas aid programmes, but since 2011 I have been working on a range of economic data issues in New Zealand.</p>
            
            <p>My interests include economics, econometrics, complex surveys, time series, spatial statistics, text mining, R, data visualisation, and anything that involves putting data and analysis in the hands of as broad a range of people as possible.</p>
            
            
            <p>The views expressed in this blog are very definitely my own, not my organisation or the New Zealand government.  I will be blogging about data and analysis issues that crop up in work, but anything controversial that relates to my work has crept in by mistake and will be removed if and when I notice it.</p>
